# Facundo Ledesma's Portfolio

Created with love :star2:.

## About The Project

I've created this project with the motivation to mix my passions for art :art:, music :guitar: & computers :computer:. I felt that the best way to do it was creating my own animations and draws (some are borrowed from lottie files) and represent all things I love that connect me with myself and the world :earth_americas:.
Took inspiration from some awesome websites :boom: out there that I really recommend you to see if you enjoy creativity, some of them are:

- [Bruno Simon][bruno-simon-url]
- [Robby Leonardi][robby-leonardi-url]
- [Jacek Jeznach][jacek-jeznach-url]

This is just the first version, a lot more to come in the future.
Hope you enjoy it! Have FUN! :beers:
